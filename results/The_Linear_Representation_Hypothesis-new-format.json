This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining linear representations in both the input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, using counterfactual examples where a concept is altered while others remain constant. The study demonstrates that these distinct formalizations connect to model \"measurement\" (predicting a concept) and \"intervention\" (manipulating a concept), respectively. A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is defined such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This specific inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, enabling the use of geometric notions like projection and similarity for interpretation and control. Experiments with LLaMA-2 validate the existence of these linear representations, the efficacy of the causal inner product in respecting semantic structure, and the practical utility of these representations for both understanding and manipulating model behavior.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests high-level concepts are linear directions in a model's representation space.\n*   The paper formalizes linear representations in both input (embedding) and output (unembedding) spaces, linking them to model measurement and intervention capabilities.\n*   A \"causal inner product\" is introduced, where causally separable concepts are orthogonal, unifying embedding and unembedding representations.\n*   This framework allows for geometric analysis (projection, similarity) of representations for interpretability and control.\n*   Empirical results with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product for understanding and manipulating model behavior.",

This paper formalizes this hypothesis by defining \"linear representation\" in terms of counterfactual pairs, connecting it to measurement (via unembedding representations) and intervention (via embedding representations). A key contribution is the introduction of a \"causal inner product,\" which is designed such that causally separable concepts are orthogonal. This causal inner product unifies the embedding and unembedding representations, allowing for the construction of intervention vectors from unembedding representations. Experiments with LLaMA-2 demonstrate the existence of these linear representations for various concepts. Crucially, the estimated causal inner product is shown to respect causal separability by exhibiting near-orthogonality between causally separable concept directions, a property not consistently held by the standard Euclidean inner product. This work provides a geometric framework for understanding and manipulating concepts within language models.\n\n2.

This paper formalizes this hypothesis, addressing the ambiguity of what \"linear representation\" precisely means by proposing three interpretations: subspace, measurement, and intervention. The authors demonstrate that these seemingly distinct notions can be unified through the concept of a \"causal inner product.\" This specialized inner product ensures that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented by orthogonal vectors. By defining and estimating this causal inner product, the paper connects the subspace representation to measurement (via linear probing) and the embedding representation to intervention (model steering). Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations for concepts, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure by showing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and demonstrate how these representations can be used for both interpreting and controlling model behavior. The study highlights the critical role of the inner product choice in making geometric notions like similarity and projection meaningful for understanding LLM representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in LLM representation spaces, linking interpretation and control to linear algebra.\n*   The paper formalizes three notions of linear representation (subspace, measurement, intervention) and unifies them using a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality for causally separable concepts.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 (7B parameters, 4,096-dimensional embeddings, trained on 2 trillion tokens) empirically validate the existence of these linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product for interpretation and control.\n*   The research demonstrates that concept directions act as linear probes (measurement) and can be used to steer model behavior (intervention).\n*   The study used 27 concepts (22 from BATS 3.0, 4 language pairs, and frequent/infrequent) to validate these findings.",

  "final_summary": "1. SUMMARY:\nThe linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts in language models are encoded as linear directions within the model's representation space. This paper formalizes this hypothesis, addressing the ambiguity of what \"linear representation\" precisely means by proposing three interpretations: subspace, measurement, and intervention. The authors demonstrate that these seemingly distinct notions can be unified through the concept of a \"causal inner product.\" This specialized inner product ensures that causally separable concepts (those that can vary independently) are represented by orthogonal vectors. By defining and estimating this causal inner product, the paper connects the subspace representation to measurement (via linear probing) and the embedding representation to intervention (model steering). Experiments with LLaMA-2 confirm the existence of linear representations for concepts, validate the causal inner product's ability to capture semantic structure by showing orthogonality between causally separable concepts, and demonstrate how these representations can be used for both interpreting and controlling model behavior. The study highlights the critical role of the inner product choice in making geometric notions like similarity and projection meaningful for understanding LLM representations.\n\n2. KEY HIGHLIGHTS:\n*   The linear representation hypothesis suggests concepts are linear directions in LLM representation spaces, linking interpretation and control to linear algebra.\n*   The paper formalizes three notions of linear representation (subspace, measurement, intervention) and unifies them using a \"causal inner product\" that enforces orthogonality for causally separable concepts.\n*   Experiments with LLaMA-2 (7B parameters, 4,096-dimensional embeddings, trained on 2 trillion tokens) empirically validate the existence of these linear representations and the utility of the causal inner product for interpretation and control.\n*   The research demonstrates that concept directions act as linear probes (measurement) and can be used to steer model behavior (intervention).\n*   The study used 27 concepts (22 from BATS 3.0, 4 language pairs, and frequent/infrequent) to validate these findings.",
