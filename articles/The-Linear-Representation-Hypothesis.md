the Geometry of Large Language Models

Abstract
Informally, the “linear representation hypothe-
sis” is the idea that high-level concepts are repre-
sented linearly as directions in some representa-
tion space. In this paper, we address two closely
related questions: What does “linear represen-
tation” actually mean? And, how do we make
sense of geometric notions (e.g., cosine similar-
ity and projection) in the representation space?
To answer these, we use the language of coun-
terfactuals to give two formalizations of linear
representation, one in the output (word) represen-
tation space, and one in the input (context) space.
We then prove that these connect to linear prob-
ing and model steering, respectively. To make
sense of geometric notions, we use the formal-
ization to identify a particular (non-Euclidean)
inner product that respects language structure in a
sense we make precise. Using this causal inner
product, we show how to unify all notions of lin-
ear representation. In particular, this allows the
construction of probes and steering vectors using
counterfactual pairs. Experiments with LLaMA-
2 demonstrate the existence of linear represen-
tations of concepts, the connection to interpre-
tation and control, and the fundamental role of
the choice of inner product. Code is available at

representation hypothesis is that—were it true—the tasks of
interpreting and controlling model behavior could exploit
linear algebraic operations on the representation space. Our
goal is to formalize the linear representation hypothesis, and
clarify how it relates to interpretation and control.

The first challenge is that it is not clear what “linear repre-
sentation” means. There are (at least) three interpretations:

1. Subspace: (e.g., Mikolov et al., 2013c; Pennington
et al., 2014) The first idea is that each concept is rep-
resented as a (1-dimensional) subspace. For example,
in the context of word embeddings, it has been ar-
gued empirically that Rep(“woman”) − Rep(“man”),
Rep(“queen”) − Rep(“king”), and all similar pairs be-
long to a common subspace (Mikolov et al., 2013c).
Then, it is natural to take this subspace to be a repre-
sentation of the concept of Male/Female.

2. Measurement: (e.g., Nanda et al., 2023; Gurnee &
Tegmark, 2023) Next is the idea that the probability of
a concept value can be measured with a linear probe.
For example, the probability that the output language
is French is logit-linear in the representation of the
input. In this case, we can take the linear map to be a
representation of the concept of English/French.

3. Intervention: (e.g., Wang et al., 2023; Turner et al.,
2023) The final idea is that the value a concept takes
on can be changed, without changing other concepts,
by adding a suitable steering vector—e.g., we change
the output from English to French by adding an
English/French vector. In this case, we take this
added vector to be a representation of the concept.

In the context of language models, the “Linear Representa-
tion Hypothesis” is the idea that high-level concepts are rep-
resented linearly in the representation space of a model (e.g.,
Mikolov et al., 2013c; Arora et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022).
High-level concepts might include: is the text in French or
English? Is it in the present or past tense? If the text is about
a person, are they male or female? The appeal of the linear

It is not clear a priori how these ideas relate to each other,
nor which is the “right” notion of linear representation.

Next, suppose we have somehow found the linear represen-
tations of various concepts. We can then use linear algebraic
operations on the representation space for interpretation and
control. For example, we might compute the cosine similar-
ity between a representation and known concept directions,
or edit representations projected onto target directions. How-
ever, similarity and projection are geometric notions: they
require an inner product on the representation space. The
second challenge is that it is not clear which inner product

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

Figure 1. The geometry of linear representations can be understood in terms of a causal inner product that respects the semantic structure
of concepts. In a language model, each concept has two separate linear representations, ¯λ (red) in the embedding (input context) space
and ¯γ (blue) in the unembedding (output word) space, as drawn on the left. The causal inner product induces a linear transformation
for the representation spaces such that the transformed linear representations coincide (purple), as drawn on the right. In this unified
representation space, causally separable concepts are represented by orthogonal vectors.

is appropriate for understanding model representations.

To address these, we make the following contributions:

as an unembedding vector γ(y) in a separate representation
space Γ ≃ Rd. The probability distribution over the next
words is then given by the softmax distribution:

1. First, we formalize the subspace notion of linear rep-
resentation in terms of counterfactual pairs, in both
“embedding” (input context) and “unembedding” (out-
put word) spaces. Using this formalization, we prove
that the unembedding notion connects to measurement,
and the embedding notion to intervention.

2. Next, we introduce the notion of a causal inner prod-
uct: an inner product with the property that concepts
that can vary freely of each other are represented as or-
thogonal vectors. We show that such an inner product
has the special property that it unifies the embedding
and unembedding representations, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 1. Additionally, we show how to estimate the inner
product using the LLM unembedding matrix.

3. Finally, we study the linear representation hypothesis
empirically using LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023). We
find the subspace notion of linear representations for a
variety of concepts. Using these, we give evidence that
the causal inner product respects semantic structure,
and that subspace representations can be used to con-
struct measurement and intervention representations.

Background on Language Models We will require some
minimal background on (large) language models. Formally,
a language model takes in context text x and samples out-
put text. This sampling is done word by word (or token
by token). Accordingly, we’ll view the outputs as single
words. To define a probability distribution over outputs,
the language model first maps each context x to a vector
λ(x) in a representation space Λ ≃ Rd. We will call these
embedding vectors. The model also represents each word y

P(y | x) ∝ exp(λ(x)⊤γ(y)).

2. The Linear Representation Hypothesis

We begin by formalizing the subspace notion of linear repre-
sentation, one in each of the unembedding and embedding
spaces of language models, and then tie the subspace notions
to the measurement and intervention notions.

2.1. Concepts

The first step is to formalize the notion of a concept. In-
tuitively, a concept is any factor of variation that can be
changed in isolation. For example, we can change the out-
put from French to English without changing its meaning,
or change the output from being about a man to about a
woman without changing the language it is written in.

Following Wang et al. (2023), we formalize this idea by
taking a concept variable W to be a latent variable that is
caused by the context X, and that acts as a cause of the out-
put Y . For simplicity of exposition, we will restrict attention
to binary concepts. Anticipating the representation of con-
cepts by vectors, we introduce an ordering on each binary
concept—e.g., male⇒female. This ordering makes the
sign of a representation meaningful (e.g., the representation
of female⇒male will have the opposite sign).

Each concept variable W defines a set of counterfactual out-
puts {Y (W = w)} that differ only in the value of W . For
example, for the concept male⇒female, (Y (0), Y (1))
is a random element of the set {(“man”, “woman”), (“king”,

“queen”), . . . }. In this paper, we assume the value of con-
cepts can be read off deterministically from the sampled
output (e.g., the output “king” implies W = 0). Then,
we can specify concepts by specifying their corresponding
counterfactual outputs.

We will eventually need to reason about the relationships
between multiple concepts. We say that two concepts W
and Z are causally separable if Y (W = w, Z = z) is
well-defined for each w, z. That is, causally separable
concepts are those that can be varied freely and in iso-
lation. For example, the concepts English⇒French
and male⇒female are causally separable—consider
{“king”, “queen”, “roi”, “reine”}. However, the concepts
English⇒French and English⇒Russian are not
because they cannot vary freely.

We’ll write Y (W = w, Z = z) as Y (w, z) when the con-
cepts are clear from context.

2.2. Unembedding Representations and Measurement

We now turn to formalizing linear representations of a con-
cept. The first observation is that there are two distinct repre-
sentation spaces in play—the embedding space Λ and the un-
embedding space Γ. A concept could be linearly represented
in either space. We begin with the unembedding space.
Defining the cone of vector v as Cone(v) = {αv : α > 0},

Definition 2.1 (Unembedding Representation). We say that
¯γW is an unembedding representation of a concept W if
γ(Y (1)) − γ(Y (0)) ∈ Cone(¯γW ) almost surely.

This definition captures the subspace notion in the unem-
bedding space, e.g., that γ(“queen”) − γ(“king”) is parallel
to γ(“woman”) − γ(“man”). We use a cone instead of sub-
space because the sign of the difference is significant—i.e.,
the difference between “king” and “queen” is in the opposite
direction as the difference between “woman” and “man”.
The unembedding representation (if it exists) is unique up
to positive scaling, consistent with the linear subspace hy-
pothesis that concepts are represented as directions.

Connection to Measurement The first result is that the
unembedding representation is closely tied to the measure-
ment notion of linear representation:

In words: if we know the output token is either “king” or
“queen” (say, the context was about a monarch), then the
probability that the output is “king” is logit-linear in the lan-
guage model representation with regression coefficients ¯γW .
The random scalar α is a function of the particular coun-
terfactual pair {Y (0), Y (1)}—e.g., it may be different for
{“king”, “queen”} and {“roi”, “reine”}. However, the di-
rection used for prediction is the same for all counterfactual
pairs demonstrating the concept.

Theorem 2.2 shows a connection between the subspace rep-
resentation and the linear representation learned by fitting a
linear probe to predict the concept. Namely, in both cases,
we get a predictor that is linear on the logit scale. However,
the unembedding representation differs from a probe-based
representation in that it does not incorporate any informa-
tion about correlated but off-target concepts. For example,
if French text were disproportionately about men, a probe
could learn this information (and include it in the represen-
tation), but the unembedding representation would not. In
this sense, the unembedding representation might be viewed
as an ideal probing representation.

2.3. Embedding Representations and Intervention

The next step is to define a linear subspace representa-
tion in the embedding space Λ. We’ll again go with

bedding space, each λ(x) defines a distribution over
concepts. We consider pairs of sentences such as
λ0 = λ(“He is the monarch of England, ”) and λ1 =
λ(“She is the monarch of England, ”) that induce different
distributions on the target concept, but the same distribu-
tion on all off-target concepts. A concept is embedding-
represented if the differences between all such pairs belong
to a common subspace. Formally,

Definition 2.3 (Embedding Representation). We say that
¯λW is an embedding representation of a concept W if we
have λ1 − λ0 ∈ Cone(¯λW ) for any context embeddings
λ0, λ1 ∈ Λ that satisfy

P(W = 1 | λ1)
P(W = 1 | λ0)

> 1

and

P(W, Z | λ1)
P(W, Z | λ0)

=

P(W | λ1)
P(W | λ0)

,

for each concept Z that is causally separable with W .

Theorem 2.2 (Measurement Representation). Let W be a
concept, and let ¯γW be the unembedding representation of
W . Then, given any context embedding λ ∈ Λ,

The first condition ensures that the direction is relevant to
the target concept, and the second condition ensures that the
direction is not relevant to off-target concepts.

logit P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ) = αλ⊤¯γW ,

where α > 0 (a.s.) is a function of {Y (0), Y (1)}.

All proofs are given in Appendix B.

Connection to Intervention It turns out the embedding
representation is closely tied to the intervention notion of
linear representation. For this, we need the following lemma
relating embedding and unembedding representations.

3

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

Lemma 2.4 (Unembedding-Embedding Relationship). Let
¯λW be the embedding representation of a concept W , and
let ¯γW and ¯γZ be the unembedding representations for W
and any concept Z that is causally separable with W . Then,

the case. To understand the challenge, consider transforming
the unembedding and embedding spaces according to

g(y) ← Aγ(y) + β,

l(x) ← A−⊤λ(x),

(3.1)

¯λ⊤
W ¯γW > 0

and

¯λ⊤
W ¯γZ = 0.

(2.1)

Conversely, if a representation ¯λW satisfies (2.1), and if
there exist concepts {Zi}d−1
i=1 , such that each Zi is causally
i=1 is the basis of Rd,
separable with W and {¯γW } ∪ {¯γZi}d−1
then ¯λW is the embedding representation for W .

We can now connect to the intervention notion:

Theorem 2.5 (Intervention Representation). Let ¯λW be the
embedding representation of a concept W . Then, for any
concept Z that is causally separable with W ,

P(Y = Y (W, 1) | Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}, λ + c¯λW )

is constant in c ∈ R, and

P(Y = Y (1, Z) | Y ∈ {Y (0, Z), Y (1, Z)}, λ + c¯λW )

is increasing in c ∈ R.

In words: adding ¯λW to the language model representation
of the context changes the probability of the target concept
(W ), but not the probability of off-target concepts (Z).

3. Inner Product for Language Model

Representations

Given linear representations, we would like to make use of
them by doing things like measuring the similarity between
different representations, or editing concepts by projecting
onto a target direction. Similarity and projection are both
notions that require an inner product. We now consider the
question of which inner product is appropriate for under-
standing language model representations.

Preliminaries We define ¯Γ to be the space of differences
between elements of Γ. Then, ¯Γ is a d-dimensional real vec-
tor space.1 We consider defining inner products on ¯Γ. Un-
embedding representations are naturally directions (unique
only up to scale). Once we have an inner product, we define
the canonical unembedding representation ¯γW to be the
element of the cone with ⟨¯γW , ¯γW ⟩ = 1. This lets us define
inner products between unembedding representations.

Unidentifiability of the inner product We might hope
that there is some natural inner product that is picked out
(identified) by the model training. It turns out that this is not

where A ∈ Rd×d is some invertible linear transformation
and β ∈ Rd is a constant. It’s easy to see that this transfor-
mation preserves the softmax distribution P(y | x):

exp(λ(x)⊤γ(y))
y′ exp(λ(x)⊤γ(y′))

(cid:80)

=

exp(l(x)⊤g(y))
y′ exp(l(x)⊤g(y′))

(cid:80)

,

∀x, y.

However, the objective function used to train the model
depends on the representations only through the softmax
probabilities. Thus, the representation γ is identified (at
best) only up to some invertible affine transformation.

This also means that the concept representations ¯γW are
identified only up to some invertible linear transformation
A. The problem is that, given any fixed inner product,

⟨¯γW , ¯γZ⟩ ̸= ⟨A¯γW , A¯γZ⟩,

in general. Accordingly, there is no obvious reason to expect
that algebraic manipulations based on, e.g., the Euclidean
inner product, should be semantically meaningful.

3.1. Causal Inner Products

We require some additional principles for choosing an
inner product on the representation space. The intu-
ition we follow here is that causally separable concepts
should be represented as orthogonal vectors. For example,
English⇒French and Male⇒Female, should be or-
thogonal. We define an inner product with this property:

Definition 3.1 (Causal Inner Product). A causal inner prod-
uct ⟨·, ·⟩C on ¯Γ ≃ Rd is an inner product such that

⟨¯γW , ¯γZ⟩C = 0,

for any pair of causally separable concepts W and Z.

This choice turns out to have the key property that it unifies
the unembedding and embedding representations:

Theorem 3.2 (Unification of Representations). Suppose
that, for any concept W , there exist concepts {Zi}d−1
i=1
is causally separable with W and
such that each Zi
i=1 is a basis of Rd. If ⟨·, ·⟩C is a causal
{¯γW } ∪ {¯γZi}d−1
inner product, then the Riesz isomorphism ¯γ (cid:55)→ ⟨¯γ, ·⟩C, for
¯γ ∈ ¯Γ, maps the unembedding representation ¯γW of each
concept W to its embedding representation ¯λW :

⟨¯γW , ·⟩C = ¯λ⊤
W .

1Note that the unembedding space Γ is only an affine space,

since the softmax is invariant to adding a constant.

To understand this result intuitively, notice we can represent
embeddings as row vectors and unembeddings as column

4

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

vectors. If the causal inner product were the Euclidean inner
product, the isomorphism would simply be the transpose
operation. The theorem is the (Riesz isomorphism) gener-
alization of this idea: each linear map on ¯Γ corresponds to
some λ ∈ Λ according to λ⊤ : ¯γ (cid:55)→ λ⊤¯γ. So, we can map
¯Γ to Λ by mapping each ¯γW to a linear function according
to ¯γW → ⟨¯γW , ·⟩C. The theorem says this map sends each
unembedding representation of a concept to the embedding
representation of the same concept.

In the experiments, we will make use of this result to con-
struct embedding representations from unembedding repre-
sentations. In particular, this allows us to find interventional
representations of concepts. This is important because it
is difficult in practice to find pairs of prompts that directly
satisfy Definition 2.3.

3.2. An Explicit Form for Causal Inner Product

The next problem is: if a causal inner product exists, how
can we find it? In principle, this could be done by finding the
unembedding representations of a large number of concepts,
and then finding an inner product that maps each pair of
causally separable directions to zero. In practice, this is
infeasible because of the number of concepts required to
find the inner product, and the difficulty of estimating the
representations of each concept.

We now turn to developing a more tractable approach based
on the following insight: knowing the value of concept W
expressed by a randomly chosen word tells us little about
the value of a causally separable concept Z expressed by
that word. For example, if we learn that a randomly sampled
word is French (not English), this does not give us significant
information about whether it refers to a man or woman.2
We formalize this idea as follows:

Assumption 3.3. Suppose W, Z are causally separable con-
cepts and that γ is an unembedding vector sampled uni-
formly from the vocabulary. Then, ¯λ⊤
Z γ are inde-
pendent3 for any embedding representations ¯λW and ¯λZ for
W and Z, respectively.

W γ and ¯λ⊤

This assumption lets us connect causal separability with
something we can actually measure: the statistical depen-
dency between words. The next result makes this precise.

Theorem 3.4 (Explicit Form of Causal Inner Product). Sup-
pose there exists a causal inner product, represented as

2Note that this assumption is about words sampled randomly
from the vocabulary, not words sampled randomly from natural
language sources.
In the latter, there may well be non-causal
correlations between causally separable concepts.

3In fact, to prove our next result, we only require that ¯λ⊤

W γ and
¯λ⊤
Z γ are uncorrelated. In Appendix D.6, we verify that the causal
inner product we find satisfies the uncorrelatedness condition.

⟨¯γ, ¯γ′⟩C = ¯γ⊤M ¯γ′ for some symmetric positive definite
matrix M . If there are mutually causally separable con-
cepts {Wk}d
k=1, such that their canonical representations
G = [¯γW1, · · · , ¯γWd] form a basis for ¯Γ ≃ Rd, then under
Assumption 3.3,

M −1 = GG⊤ and G⊤Cov(γ)−1G = D,

(3.2)

for some diagonal matrix D with positive entries, where γ
is the unembedding vector of a word sampled uniformly at
random from the vocabulary.

Notice that causal orthogonality only imposes d(d − 1)/2
constraints on the inner product, but there are d(d−1)/2+d
degrees of freedom in identifying the positive definite matrix
M (hence, an inner product)—thus, we expect d degrees of
freedom in choosing a causal inner product. Theorem 3.4
gives a characterization of this class of inner products, in the
form of (3.2). Here, D is a free parameter with d degrees
of freedom. Each D defines the inner product. We do not
have a principle for picking out a unique choice of D. In our
experiments, we will work with the choice D = Id, which
gives us M = Cov(γ)−1. Then, we have a simple closed
form for the corresponding inner product:

⟨¯γ, ¯γ′⟩C := ¯γ⊤Cov(γ)−1¯γ′,

∀¯γ, ¯γ′ ∈ ¯Γ.

(3.3)

Note that although we don’t have a unique inner product,
we can rule out most inner products. E.g., the Euclidean
inner product is not a causal inner product if M = Id does
not satisfy (3.2) for any D.

Unified representations The choice of inner product can
also be viewed as defining a choice of representations g and
l in (3.1) (hence, ¯g = A¯γ). With A = M 1/2, Theorem 3.2
further implies that a causal inner product makes the em-
bedding and unembedding representations of concepts the
same, that is, ¯gW = ¯lW . Moreover, in the transformed
space, the Euclidean inner product is the causal inner prod-
uct: ⟨¯γ, ¯γ′⟩C = ¯g⊤¯g′. In Figure 1, we illustrated this uni-
fication of unembedding and embedding representations.
This is convenient for experiments, because it allows the use
of standard Euclidean tools on the transformed space.

4. Experiments

We now turn to empirically validating the existence of linear
representations, the estimated causal inner product, and the
predicted relationships between the subspace, measurement,
and intervention notions of linear representation. Code is
available at github.com/KihoPark/linear rep geometry.

We use the LLaMA-2 model with 7 billion parameters (Tou-
vron et al., 2023) as our testbed. This is a decoder-only
Transformer LLM (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al.,
2018), trained using the forward LM objective and a 32K

token vocabulary. We include further details on all experi-
ments in Appendix C.

Concepts are represented as directions in the unembed-
ding space We start with the hypothesis that concepts are
represented as directions in the unembedding representation
space (Definition 2.1). This notion relies on counterfactual
pairs of words that vary only in the value of the concept of in-
terest. We consider 22 concepts defined in the Big Analogy
Test Set (BATS 3.0) (Gladkova et al., 2016), which provides
such counterfactual pairs.4 We also consider 4 language
English⇒French, French⇒German,
concepts:
French⇒Spanish, and German⇒Spanish, where
translations as counterfac-
we use words and their
tual pairs.
the concept
Additionally, we consider
frequent⇒infrequent capturing how common a
word is—we use pairs of common/uncommon synonyms
(e.g., “bad” and “terrible”) as counterfactual pairs. We pro-
vide a table of all 27 concepts we consider in Appendix C.

If the subspace notion of the linear representation hy-
pothesis holds, then all counterfactual token pairs should
point to a common direction in the unembedding space.
In practice, this will only hold approximately. However,
if the linear representation hypothesis holds, we still ex-
pect that, e.g., γ(“queen”) − γ(“king”) will align with the
male⇒female direction (more closely than the differ-
ence between random word pairs will). To validate this, for
each concept W , we look at how the direction defined by
each counterfactual pair, γ(yi(1)) − γ(yi(0)), is geometri-
cally aligned with the unembedding representation ¯γW . We
estimate ¯γW as the (normalized) mean5 among all counter-
factual pairs: ¯γW := ˜γW /(cid:112)⟨˜γW , ˜γW ⟩C, where

Figure 2. Projecting counterfactual pairs onto their corresponding
concept direction shows a strong right skew, as we expect if the
linear representation hypothesis holds. The projections of the
counterfactual pairs, ⟨¯γW,(−i), γ(yi(1)) − γ(yi(0))⟩C, are shown
in red. For reference, we also project the differences between 100K
randomly sampled word pairs onto the estimated concept direction,
as shown in blue. See Table 2 for details about each concept W
(the title of each plot).

mately orthogonally under the estimated causal inner product based

for each concept is given in Table 2.

Figure 2 presents histograms of each γ(yi(1)) − γ(yi(0)))
projected onto ¯γW with respect to the causal inner product.
Since ¯γW is computed using γ(yi(1)) − γ(yi(0)), we com-
pute each projection using a leave-one-out (LOO) estimate
¯γW,(−i) of the concept direction that excludes (yi(0), yi(1)).
Across the three concepts shown (and 23 others shown in
Appendix D.1), the differences between counterfactual pairs
are substantially more aligned with ¯γW than those between
random pairs. The sole exception is thing⇒part, which
does not appear to have a linear representation.

4We only utilize words that are single tokens in the LLaMA-2

model. See Appendix C for details.

5Previous work on word embeddings (Drozd et al., 2016;
Fournier et al., 2020) motivate taking the mean to improve the
consistency of the concept direction.

The results are consistent with the linear representation
hypothesis: the differences computed by each counterfac-
tual pair point to a common direction representing a linear
subspace (up to some noise). Further, ¯γW is a reasonable
estimator for that direction.

The estimated inner product respects causal separability
Next, we directly examine whether the estimated inner prod-
uct (3.3) chosen from Theorem 3.4 is indeed approximately
a causal inner product. In Figure 3, we plot a heatmap
of the inner products between all pairs of the estimated
unembedding representations for the 27 concepts. If the
estimated inner product is a causal inner product, then we
expect values near 0 between causally separable concepts.

The first observation is that most pairs of concepts are
nearly orthogonal with respect to this inner product. In-
terestingly, there is also a clear block diagonal structure.

This arises because the concepts are grouped by seman-
tic similarity. For example, the first 10 concepts relate to
verbs, and the last 4 concepts are language pairs. The addi-
tional non-zero structure also generally makes sense. For
example, lower⇒upper (capitalization, concept 19) has
non-trivial inner product with the language pairs other than
French⇒Spanish. This may be because French and
Spanish obey similar capitalization rules, while English and
German each have different conventions (e.g., German capi-
talizes all nouns, but English only capitalizes proper nouns).
In Appendix D.2, we compare the Euclidean inner product
to the causal inner product for both the LLaMA-2 model
and a more recent Gemma large language model (Mesnard
et al., 2024).

Concept directions act as linear probes Next, we
check the connection to the measurement notion of lin-
ear representation. We consider the concept W =
French⇒Spanish. To construct a dataset of French and
Spanish contexts, we sample contexts of random lengths
from Wikipedia pages in each language. Note that these
are not counterfactual pairs. Following Theorem 2.2, we
expect ¯γ⊤
j ) > 0. Figure 4 con-
firms this expectation, showing that ¯γW is a linear probe
for the concept W in Λ (left). Also, the representation of
an off-target concept Z = male⇒female does not have
any predictive power for this task (right). Appendix D.3
includes analogous results using all 27 concepts.

Each context xj is presented in Table 4.

¯λW := Cov(γ)−1¯γW .

(4.1)

Theorem 2.5 predicts that adding ¯λW to a context represen-
tation should increase the probability of W , while leaving
the probability of all causally separable concepts unaltered.

To test this for a given pair of causally separable concepts
W and Z, we first choose a quadruple {Y (w, z)}w,z∈{0,1},
and then generate contexts {xj} such that the next word
should be Y (0, 0). For example, if W = male⇒female
and Z = lower⇒upper, then we choose the quadruple
(“king”, “queen”, “King”, “Queen”), and generate contexts
using ChatGPT-4 (e.g., “Long live the”). We then intervene
on λ(xj) using ¯λC via

λC,α(xj) = λ(xj) + α¯λC,

(4.2)

where α > 0 and C can be W , Z, or some other causally
separable concept (e.g., French⇒Spanish). For dif-
ferent choices of C, we plot the changes in logit P(W =
1 | Z, λ) and logit P(Z = 1 | W, λ), as we increase α.
We expect to see that, if we intervene in the W direction,
then the intervention should linearly increase logit P(W =
1 | Z, λ), while the other logit should stay constant; if we
intervene in a direction C that is causally separable with
both W and Z, then we expect both logits to stay constant.

Concept directions map to intervention representations
Theorem 2.5 says that we can construct an intervention
representation by constructing an embedding representa-
tion. Doing this directly requires finding pairs of prompts
that vary only on the distribution they induce on the target
concept, which can be difficult to find in practice.

Figure 5 shows the results of one such experiment shown
for three target concepts (24 others shown in Appendix D.4),
confirming our expectations. We see, for example, that
intervening in the male⇒female direction raises the logit
for choosing “queen” over “king” as the next word, but does
not change the logit for “King” over “king”.

Here, we will instead use the isomorphism between embed-
ding and unembedding representations (Theorem 3.2) to
construct intervention representations from unembedding

A natural follow-up question is to see if the intervention
in a concept direction (for W ) pushes the probability of
Y (W = 1) being the next word to be the largest among all

Table 1. Adding the intervention representation α¯λW pushes the
probability over completions to reflect the concept W . As the scale
of intervention increases, the probability of seeing Y (W = 1)
(“queen”) increases while the probability of seeing Y (W = 0)
(“king”) decreases. We show the top-5 most probable words over
the entire vocabulary following the intervention (4.2) in the W =
male⇒female direction, i.e., λW,α(x) = λ(x) + α¯λW , for
α ∈ {0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4}. The original context x = “Long live
the ” is a sentence fragment that ends with the word Y (W = 0)
(“king”). The most likely words reflect the concept, with “queen”
being top-1. In Appendix D.5, we provide more examples.

tokens. We expect to see that, as we increase the value of α,
the target concept should eventually be reflected in the most
likely output words according to the LM.

In Table 1, we show an illustrative example in which W is
the concept male⇒female and the context x is a sentence
fragment that can end with the word Y (W = 0) (“king”).
For x = “Long live the ”, as we increase the scale α on
the intervention, we see that the target word Y (W = 1)
(“queen”) becomes the most likely next word, while the
original word Y (W = 0) drops below the top-5 list. This
illustrates how the intervention can push the probability of
the target word high enough to make it the most likely word
while decreasing the probability of the original word.

5. Discussion and Related Work

The idea that high-level concepts are encoded linearly is
appealing because—if it is true—it may open up simple
methods for interpretation and control of LLMs. In this pa-
per, we have formalized ‘linear representation’, and shown
that all natural variants of this notion can be unified.6 This
equivalence already suggests some approaches for interpre-
tation and control—e.g., we show how to use collections
of pairs of words to define concept directions, and then use
these directions to predict what the model’s output will be,
and to change the output in a controlled fashion. A major
theme is the role played by the choice of inner product.

Linear subspaces in language representations The lin-
ear subspace hypotheses was originally observed empir-
ically in the context of word embeddings (e.g., Mikolov
et al., 2013b;c; Levy & Goldberg, 2014; Goldberg & Levy,
2014; Vylomova et al., 2016; Gladkova et al., 2016; Chiang

6In Appendix A, we summarize these results in a figure.

8

et al., 2020; Fournier et al., 2020). Similar structure has
been observed in cross-lingual word embeddings (Mikolov
et al., 2013a; Lample et al., 2018; Ruder et al., 2019; Peng
et al., 2022), sentence embeddings (Bowman et al., 2016;
Zhu & de Melo, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Ushio et al., 2021),
representation spaces of Transformer LLMs (Meng et al.,
2022; Merullo et al., 2023; Hernandez et al., 2023), and
vision-language models (Wang et al., 2023; Trager et al.,
2023; Perera et al., 2023). These observations motivate Def-
inition 2.1. The key idea in the present paper is providing
formalization in terms of counterfactual pairs—this is what
allows us to connect to other notions of linear representation,
and to identify the inner product structure.

Measurement,
intervention, and mechanistic inter-
pretability There is a significant body of work on linear
representations for interpreting (probing) (e.g., Alain & Ben-
gio, 2017; Kim et al., 2018; nostalgebraist, 2020; Rogers
et al., 2021; Belinkov, 2022; Li et al., 2022; Geva et al.,
2022; Nanda et al., 2023) and controlling (steering) (e.g.,
Wang et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Merullo et al., 2023;
Trager et al., 2023) models. This is particularly prominent in
mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Meng et al.,
2022; Hernandez et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al.,
2023; Todd et al., 2023; Hendel et al., 2023). With respect
to this body of work, the main contribution of the present
paper is to clarify the linear representation hypothesis, and
the critical role of the inner product. However, we do not
address interpretability of either model parameters, nor the
activations of intermediate layers. These are main focuses
of existing work. It is an exciting direction for future work
to understand how ideas here—particularly, the causal inner
product—translate to these settings.

Geometry of representations There is a line of work that
studies the geometry of word and sentence representations
(e.g., Arora et al., 2016; Mimno & Thompson, 2017; Etha-
yarajh, 2019; Reif et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Hewitt &
Manning, 2019; Chen et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Jiang
et al., 2023). This work considers, e.g., visualizing and
modeling how the learned embeddings are distributed, or
how hierarchical structure is encoded. Our work is largely
orthogonal to these, since we are attempting to define a
suitable inner product (and thus, notions of similarity and
projection) that respects the semantic structure of language.

Causal representation learning Finally, the ideas here
connect to causal representation learning (e.g., Higgins
et al., 2016; Hyvarinen & Morioka, 2016; Higgins et al.,
2018; Khemakhem et al., 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021;
Sch¨olkopf et al., 2021; Moran et al., 2021; Wang et al.,
2023). Most obviously, our causal formalization of con-
cepts is inspired by Wang et al. (2023), who establish a
characterization of latent concepts and vector algebra in dif-

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

fusion models. Separately, a major theme in this literature
is the identifiability of learned representations—i.e., to what
extent they capture underlying real-world structure. Our
causal inner product results may be viewed in this theme,
showing that an inner product respecting semantic closeness
is not identified by the usual training procedure, but that it
can be picked out with a suitable assumption.

A. Summary of Main Results

In Figure 6, we give a high-level summary of our main results. In Section 2, we have given the definitions of unembedding
and embedding representations and how they also yield measurement and intervention representations, respectively. In
Section 3, we have defined the causal inner product and show how it unifies the unembedding and embedding representations
via the induced Riesz isomorphism.

B. Proofs

B.1. Proof of Theorem 2.2

Theorem 2.2 (Measurement Representation). Let W be a concept, and let ¯γW be the unembedding representation of W .
Then, given any context embedding λ ∈ Λ,

where α > 0 (a.s.) is a function of {Y (0), Y (1)}.

logit P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ) = αλ⊤¯γW ,

Proof. The proof involves writing out the softmax sampling distribution and invoking Definition 2.1.

logit P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ)

= log

P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ)
P(Y = Y (0) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ)

= λ⊤ {γ(Y (1)) − γ(Y (0))}
= α · λ⊤¯γW .

(B.1)

(B.2)

(B.3)

(B.4)

In (B.3), we simply write out the softmax distribution, allowing us to cancel out the normalizing constants for the two
probabilities. Equation (B.4) follows directly from Definition 2.1; note that the randomness of α comes from the randomness
of {Y (0), Y (1)}.

B.2. Proof of Lemma 2.4
Lemma B.1 (Unembedding-Embedding Relationship). Let ¯λW be the embedding representation of a concept W , and let
¯γW and ¯γZ be the unembedding representations for W and any concept Z that is causally separable with W . Then,

¯λ⊤
W ¯γW > 0
Conversely, if a representation ¯λW satisfies (2.1), and if there exist concepts {Zi}d−1
separable with W and {¯γW } ∪ {¯γZi}d−1

¯λ⊤
W ¯γZ = 0.

i=1 is the basis of Rd, then ¯λW is the embedding representation for W .

and

i=1 , such that each Zi is causally

(2.1)

Proof. Let λ0, λ1 be a pair of embeddings such that

P(W = 1 | λ1)
P(W = 1 | λ0)

> 1

and

P(W, Z | λ1)
P(W, Z | λ0)

=

P(W | λ1)
P(W | λ0)

,

(B.5)

13

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

for any concept Z that is causally separable with W . Then, by Definition 2.3,

λ1 − λ0 ∈ Cone(¯λW ).

The condition (B.5) is equivalent to

P(W = 1 | λ1)
P(W = 1 | λ0)

> 1

and

P(Z = 1 | W, λ1)
P(Z = 1 | W, λ0)

= 1.

These two conditions are also equivalent to the following pair of conditions, respectively:

and

P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ1)
P(Y = Y (1) | Y ∈ {Y (0), Y (1)}, λ0)

> 1

P(Y = Y (W, 1) | Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}, λ1)
P(Y = Y (W, 1) | Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}, λ0)

= 1

(B.6)

(B.7)

(B.8)

(B.9)

The reason is that, conditional on Y ∈ {Y (0, 0), Y (0, 1), Y (1, 0), Y (1, 1)}, conditioning on W is equivalent to conditioning
on Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}. And, the event Z = 1 is equivalent to the event Y = Y (W, 1). (In words: if we know the
output is one of “king”, “queen”, “roi”, “reine” then conditioning on W = 1 is equivalent to conditioning on the output
being “king” or “roi”. Then, predicting whether the word is in English is equivalent to predicting whether the word is
“king”.)

By Theorem 2.2, the two conditions (B.8) and (B.9) are respectively equivalent to

α(Y (0), Y (1))(λ1 − λ0)⊤¯γW > 0

and α(Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1))(λ1 − λ0)⊤¯γZ = 0,

(B.10)

where α’s are positive a.s. These are in turn respectively equivalent to

¯λ⊤
W ¯γW > 0

and

¯λ⊤
W ¯γZ = 0.

(B.11)

Conversely, if a representation ¯λW satisfies (B.11) and there exist concepts {Zi}d−1
separable with W and {¯γW } ∪ {¯γZi}d−1
λ1 satisfying (B.5), then the equivalence between (B.5) and (B.10) says that

i=1 such that each concept is causally
i=1 is the basis of Rd, then ¯λW is unique up to positive scaling. If there exists λ0 and

(λ1 − λ0)⊤¯γW > 0

and (λ1 − λ0)⊤¯γZ = 0.

(B.12)

In other words, λ1 − λ0 also satisfies (B.11), implying that it must be the same as ¯λW up to positive scaling. Therefore, for
any λ0 and λ1 satisfying (B.5), λ1 − λ0 ∈ Cone(¯λW ).

B.3. Proof of Theorem 2.5
Theorem 2.5 (Intervention Representation). Let ¯λW be the embedding representation of a concept W . Then, for any
concept Z that is causally separable with W ,

P(Y = Y (W, 1) | Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}, λ + c¯λW )

P(Y = Y (1, Z) | Y ∈ {Y (0, Z), Y (1, Z)}, λ + c¯λW )

is constant in c ∈ R, and

is increasing in c ∈ R.

Proof. By Theorem 2.2,

logit P(Y = Y (W, 1) | Y ∈ {Y (W, 0), Y (W, 1)}, λ + c¯λW )
= α · (λ + c¯λW )⊤¯γZ
= α · λ⊤¯γZ + αc · ¯λ⊤

W ¯γZ

(B.13)

(B.14)

(B.15)

14

The Linear Representation Hypothesis and the Geometry of Large Language Models

Therefore, the first probability is constant since ¯λ⊤

W ¯γZ = 0 by Lemma 2.4.

Also, by Theorem 2.2,

logit P(Y = Y (1, Z) | Y ∈ {Y (0, Z), Y (1, Z)}, λ + c¯λW )
= α · (λ + c¯λW )⊤¯γW
= α · λ⊤¯γZ + αc · ¯λ⊤

W ¯γW

(B.16)

(B.17)

(B.18)

Therefore, the second probability is increasing since ¯λ⊤

W ¯γW > 0 by Lemma 2.4.

B.4. Proof of Theorem 3.2

Theorem 3.2 (Unification of Representations). Suppose that, for any concept W , there exist concepts {Zi}d−1
i=1 such that
i=1 is a basis of Rd. If ⟨·, ·⟩C is a causal inner product, then the
each Zi is causally separable with W and {¯γW } ∪ {¯γZi}d−1
Riesz isomorphism ¯γ (cid:55)→ ⟨¯γ, ·⟩C, for ¯γ ∈ ¯Γ, maps the unembedding representation ¯γW of each concept W to its embedding
representation ¯λW :

⟨¯γW , ·⟩C = ¯λ⊤
W .

Proof. The causal inner product defines the Riesz isomorphism ϕ such that ϕ(¯γ) = ⟨¯γ, ·⟩C. Then, we have

ϕ(¯γW )(¯γW ) = ⟨¯γW , ¯γW ⟩C > 0

and ϕ(¯γW )(¯γZ) = ⟨¯γW , ¯γZ⟩C = 0,

(B.19)

where the second equality follows from Definition 3.1. By Lemma 2.4, ϕ(¯γW ) expresses the unique unembedding
representation ¯λW (up to positive scaling); specifically, ϕ(¯γW ) = ¯λ⊤

W : ¯γ (cid:55)→ ¯λ⊤

W where ¯λ⊤

W ¯γ.

B.5. Proof of Theorem 3.4

Theorem 3.4 (Explicit Form of Causal Inner Product). Suppose there exists a causal inner product, represented as ⟨¯γ, ¯γ′⟩C =
¯γ⊤M ¯γ′ for some symmetric positive definite matrix M . If there are mutually causally separable concepts {Wk}d
k=1, such
that their canonical representations G = [¯γW1, · · · , ¯γWd ] form a basis for ¯Γ ≃ Rd, then under Assumption 3.3,

M −1 = GG⊤ and G⊤Cov(γ)−1G = D,

(3.2)

for some diagonal matrix D with positive entries, where γ is the unembedding vector of a word sampled uniformly at
random from the vocabulary.

Proof. Since ⟨·, ·⟩C is a causal inner product,

0 = ¯γ⊤

W M ¯γZ

(B.20)

for any causally separable concepts W and Z. By applying (B.20) to the canonical representations G = [¯γW1 , · · · , ¯γWd ],
we obtain

I = G⊤M G.

(B.21)

This shows that M = G−⊤G−1, proving the first half of (3.2).

Next, observe that M ¯γWi is an embedding representation for each concept Wi for i = 1, · · · , d by the proof of Lemma 2.4
and Theorem 3.2. Then, by Assumption 3.3,

for i ̸= j. Thus,

0 = Cov(¯γ⊤
Wi

M γ, ¯γ⊤
Wj

M γ)

= ¯γ⊤
Wi

M Cov(γ)M ¯γWj .

D−1 = G⊤M Cov(γ)M G,

for some diagonal matrix D with positive entries. Substituting in M = G−⊤G−1, we get

proving the second half of (3.2).

Cov(γ) = GD−1G⊤,

C. Experiment Details

The LLaMA-2 model We utilize the llama-2-7b variant of the LLaMA-2 model (Touvron et al., 2023), which is
accessible online (with permission) via the huggingface library.7 Its seven billion parameters are pre-trained on two
trillion sentencepiece (Kudo & Richardson, 2018) tokens, 90% of which is in English. This model uses 32,000 tokens
and 4,096 dimensions for its token embeddings.

Counterfactual pairs Tokenization poses a challenge in using certain words. First, a word can be tokenized to more than
one token. For example, a word “princess” is tokenized to “prin” + “cess”, and γ(“princess”) does not exist. Thus, we
cannot obtain the meaning of the exact word “princess”. Second, a word can be used as one of the tokens for another word.
For example, the French words “bas” and “est” (“down” and “east” in English) are in the tokens for the words “basalt”,
“baseline”, “basil”, “basilica”, “basin”, “estuary”, “estrange”, “estoppel”, “estival”, “esthetics”, and “estrogen”. Therefore, a
word can have another meaning other than the meaning of the exact word.

When we collect the counterfactual pairs to identify ¯γW , the first issue in the pair can be handled by not using it. However,
the second issue cannot be handled, and it gives a lot of noise to our results. Table 2 presents the number of the counterfactual
pairs for each concept and one example of the pairs. The pairs for 13, 17, 19, 23-27th concepts are generated by ChatGPT-
4 (OpenAI, 2023), and those for 16th concept are based on the csv file8). The other concepts are based on The Bigger
Analogy Test Set (BATS) (Gladkova et al., 2016), version 3.09, which is used for evaluation of the word analogy task.

In Section 4, for a concept W (e.g., English⇒French), we choose several counterfactual pairs

via ChatGPT-4. We discard the contexts such that Y (0, 0) is not the top 1 next word. Table 4 present the contexts we use.

D. Additional Results

D.1. Histograms of random and counterfactual pairs for all concepts

In Figure 7, we include an analog of Figure 2 where we check the causal inner product of the differences between the
counterfactual pairs and an LOO estimated unembedding representation for each of the 27 concepts. While the most of the
concepts are encoded in the unembedding representation, some concepts, such as thing⇒part, are not encoded in the
unembedding space Γ.

D.2. Comparison with the Euclidean inner products

In Figure 8, we also plot the cosine similarities induced by the Euclidean inner product between the unembedding
representations. Surprisingly, the Euclidean inner product somewhat works in the LLaMA-2 model as most of the causally
separable concepts are orthogonal! This may due to some initialization or implicit regularizing effect that favors learning
unembeddings with approximately isotropic covariance. Nevertheless, the estimated causal inner product clearly improves
on the Euclidean inner product. For example, frequent⇒infrequent (concept 23) has high Euclidean inner product
with many separable concepts, and these are much smaller for the causal inner product. Conversely, English⇒French
(24) has low Euclidean inner product with the other language concepts (25-27), but high causal inner product with
French⇒German and French⇒Spanish (while being nearly orthogonal to German⇒Spanish, which does not
share French).

Interestingly, the same heatmaps for a more recent Gemma-2B model (Mesnard et al., 2024) in Figure 9 illustrate that the
Euclidean inner product doesn’t capture semantics, while the causal inner product still works. One possible reason is that
the origin of the unembeddings is meaningful as the Gemma model ties the unembeddings to the token embeddings used
before the transformer layers.

D.3. Additional results from the measurement experiment

We include analogs of Figure 4, specifically where we use each of the 27 concepts as a linear probe on either
French⇒Spanish (Figure 10) or English⇒French (Figure 11) contexts.

D.4. Additional results from the intervention experiment
In Figure 12, we include an analog of Figure 5 where we add the embedding representation α¯λC (4.1) for each of the 27
concepts to λ(xj) and see the change in logits.

D.5. Additional tables of top-5 words after intervention

Table 5 and Table 6 are analogs of Table 1 where we use different contexts x = “In a monarchy, the ruler usually is a ” and
x = “The prince matured and eventually became the ”. For the first example, note that “r” and “em” are the prefix tokens
for words related to royalty, such as “ruler”, “royal”, and “emperor”. For the second example, even when the target word
“queen” does not become the most likely one, the most likely words still reflect the concept direction (“woman”, “queen”,
“her”, “female”).

D.6. A sanity check for the estimated causal inner product

In earlier experiments, we found that the choice M = Cov(γ)−1 from (3.3) yields a causal inner product and induces
an embedding representation ¯λW in the form of (4.1). Here, we run a sanity check experiment where we verify that the
induced embedding representation satisfies the uncorrelatedness condition in Assumption D.6. In Figure 13, we empirically
show that ¯λ⊤
Z γ are uncorrelated for the causally separable concepts (left plot), while they are correlated for the
non-causally separable concepts (right plot). In these plots, each dot corresponds to the point (¯λ⊤
Z γ), where γ is an
unembedding vector γ corresponding to each token in the LLaMA-2 vocabulary (32K total).

Figure 8. For the LLaMA-2-7B model, causally separable concepts are approximately orthogonal under the estimated causal inner
product and, surprisingly, under the Euclidean inner product as well. The heatmaps show |⟨¯γW , ¯γZ ⟩| for the estimated unembedding
representations of each concept pair (W, Z). The plot on the left shows the estimated inner product based on (3.3), and the right plot
represents the Euclidean inner product. The detail for the concepts is given in Table 2.
